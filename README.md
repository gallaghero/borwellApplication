# Borwell Application
Borwell Application takes in the dimensions of a room and one door in feet or metres and outputs the area of the floor, the volume of the room and the amount of paint required to paint the walls in litres.


To run the program, download and open the borwellApplication.jar file.


Assumptions I have made in producing this program are:

  -The room is a simple cuboid shape with no alcoves, diagonal walls or a slanted ceiling.
  
  -The amount of paint needed to pain the alcove of a window is similar to that of the wall space the window takes up.
  
  -The room is painted with a single coat of paint.
  
  -The room only has one door
  
  -1 litre of paint covers 10m^2 of wall (as suggested on the B&Q Wall Painting Calculator: http://www.diy.com/help-advice/wall-painting-calculator/Dev_npcart_100008.art)
